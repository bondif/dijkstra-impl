# Dijkstra Implementation

This is a Dijkstra algorithm implementation using C language.    
**Input**: Adjacency matrix, and the number of the starting node   
**Output**: Path and distance between the chosen node and all other nodes

# Example : Road traffic between Moroccan cities
## Our problem

This the map that we are going to use:    
The road map is made up of 20 cities which represent the nodes.
(Note: each city is numbered from 1 to 20 in the following order)   
DAKHLA, AGADIR, AL HOCEIMA, BENIMELLAL, CASABLANCA, TANTAN, EL JADIDA, ESSAOUIRA, FES, LAAYOUN, LAGWIRA, MARRAKECH, MEKNES, OUARZAZATE, OUJDA, RABAT, SAFI, TANGIER, TAZA, TETOUAN  
**Criteria** : distance between cities

## Step by step execution
1. Enter the count of nodes: 20 (according to our example)   
![Enter the count of nodes](https://github.com/bondif/dijkstra-impl/blob/master/screenshots/enter_count_nodes.jpg "Enter the count of nodes")    

2. Enter the adjacency matrix

3. Enter the starting node: we've chosen 2 which referes to AGADIR    
![Enter the starting node](https://github.com/bondif/dijkstra-impl/blob/master/screenshots/starting_node.jpg "Enter the starting node")    

4. Result: Path and distance between 2 (AGADIR) and all the other cities
